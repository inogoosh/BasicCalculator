# 🧮 Beginner's Calculator in Python
This is a simple and interactive Command-Line Calculator written in Python. It supports basic arithmetic operations, square, square root, exponentiation, and average calculation. Great for beginners who are learning how to use if-else, functions, loops, and user input in Python!

# 🤖 Features
This calculator supports the following operations:

*Operation	Description

"+"    -    Addition of two numbers
    
"-"	   -    Subtraction of two numbers
  
"*"	   -    Multiplication of two numbers

"/"    -    Division of two numbers (with division-by-zero check)

"sqr"	 -    Square of a number

"sqrt" -    Square root of a number

"exp"	 -    Exponentiation (e.g., 2^3)

"avg"	 -    Calculates average of multiple numbers

# 🤺 How to Use
Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.x).

Run the program:

You will be asked to enter the operation you want to perform.

Then you'll be prompted to input numbers depending on the operation.

Example:

Enter the operation you want to perform (+, -, *, /, sqr, sqrt, exp, avg) or any other key to Exit: +

Enter first Number : 5

Enter second Number : 3

The value of 5.0 + 3.0 is: 8.0
